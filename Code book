CodeBook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

Study Design

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy 
S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

Code Book

Unzip the file containing the data in your working directory.

There should be four Â´".txt" files:

    'README.txt' providing information about the measurements and their scope.
    'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
    'features.txt': List of all names of the measurements.
    'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

And two folders called "training" and "test" containing:

    'train/X_train.txt': Set of measurements undertaken during the training.
    'train/y_train.txt': Labels of measurements undertaken during the training.
    'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample during the training. Its range is from 1 to 30.
    'test/X_test.txt': Set of measurements undertaken during the test.
    'test/y_test.txt': Labels of measurements undertaken during the test.
    'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample during the test. Its range is from 1 to 30.

The following files are available in a folder called "InertialSignals" for the train and test data but they are not used. Their descriptions are equivalent.

    'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
    'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
    'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
